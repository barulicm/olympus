- Implement full state export/import for disaster recovery
- Refocus to FLL only?
  - Remove phases and matches, just need to track teams and their scores
  - Generate scorecards from "mission descriptions"
  - Remove static vs dynamic pages, since scorecard would be only thing changing
  - Make number of rounds runtime configurable?

- Refactor a "Session" object that holds the session state (team / schedule / setup state / config values?)
